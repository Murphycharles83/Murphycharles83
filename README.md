ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in penetration testing, Kali Linux, ethical hacking, programming, learning the different languages within each the well endowed cyber injury.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to read and write and use cmd line for Linux and windows.

ðŸ’ž I'm looking to collaborate on learning the ins and outs of coding and ethical- hacking. It amazes me and intrigues me to know how everything works and how simple things really are once you learn the language. I want to speak many languages within the cyber world 
I would love to be able to develop my own programs for penetration testing and not just be a newb copy and paste junkie.
